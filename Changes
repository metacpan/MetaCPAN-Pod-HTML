  - add Pod::Simple::Role::XHTML::WithHighlightConfig role, to allow pod to
    provide hints for syntax highlighting of verbatim sections
  - fix stripping indentation from verbatim blocks to not always convert tabs
    to spaces
  - enable the anchor_items option by default
  - split roles to provide more precise link targets and to add additional
    compatibility targets
  - prepare for compatibility with future Pod::Simple releases that will fix
    the encoding of ids and link targets
  - add additional link targets after processing the entire file, rather than
    part way through. this will prevent the extra targets from taking priority
    over later headings.
